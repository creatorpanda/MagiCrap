# Magicrap
A super simple script that kills the PC game "Magicka" after it misbehaves due to multiplayer issues (***client side***).
It was created to safely stop the game from working on the background. **Please read**.

# Why i made this
When the host started a multiplayer game (**3 players in total**: me, the host playing with mouse and keyboard and his local friend playing from the same PC with a controller), **his client would most of the time crash/close and my client would stay forever in the loading screen** unless i killed the game using a CMD, cause just pressing the X button from the taskbar icon would make the icon disappear but **the game would keep running as an invisible task**, therefore being unable to start it again.

*The host's Steam client would freeze and he would have to restart his PC. So i changed this script a bit and Created the KillSteam.bat script! I may upload it as well, here or independently! :D*

# Notes
*Note: This script only safely kills/stops the game. It does ***NOT*** fix the issue. It's just a safe and fast solution rather than restarting your whole PC in the case of getting stuck in the loading screen - **as a game's client and not a host** - so you can get to try and restart the whole client again.*

**SUPER WARNING!!!: Your Windows Defender (or other programs) may tag this file as "not safe" or something and try to prevent you from running it(maybe because it's trying to kill the game process). Don't worry, it's false positive! It's totally safe!**
